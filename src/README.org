TREXIO is an open-source file format and library developed for the storage and
manipulation of data produced by quantum chemistry calculations. It was
designed with the goal of providing a reliable and efficient method of storing
and exchanging wave function parameters and matrix elements.

The library consists of a front-end implemented in the C programming language
and two different back-ends: a text back-end and a binary back-end utilizing
the HDF5 library enabling fast read and write speeds.  It is compatible with a
variety of platforms and has interfaces for Fortran, Python, and OCaml.

If you use TREXIO, please cite this article published in the [[https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0148161][Journal of Chemical Physics]]:
